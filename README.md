AdventOfCode

As you can guess, these are my solutions to the various AoC challenges over the years. Slow but surely I'm catching up with the years I missed. I'm a C# developer, but sometimes it is just quicker 
to do the challenage in JavaScript...

My disclaimer, I have not clean-up all the code, some of it might be a bit ugly. Would appreciate if you have me a star, if you found it useful.
